// Since I didn't install cva/radix/utils, I will use a simpler version or I should install them.
// User didn't ask for shadcn explicitly but "Minimalist" usually implies it.
// I'll stick to pure Tailwind for simplicity as I didn't verify other deps, 
// BUT I installed `clsx` and `tailwind-merge`.
// I will create a `lib/utils.ts` first.
